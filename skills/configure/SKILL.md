# /remo-code:configure

Save the hub URL and session token so the channel plugin can connect.

## Steps

1. Create the config directory at `~/.claude/channels/remo-code/` if it doesn't exist
2. Write the `.env` file with `HUB_URL` and `HUB_TOKEN`
3. Set file permissions to owner-only (chmod 600)
4. Tell the user to restart Claude Code with `--channels` to activate

## Template

Write this to `~/.claude/channels/remo-code/.env`:

```
HUB_URL={{hub_url}}
HUB_TOKEN={{token}}
SESSION_ID={{default to basename of current working directory}}
```

After writing, set permissions:
```bash
chmod 600 ~/.claude/channels/remo-code/.env
```

Then tell the user:
> Configuration saved. Restart Claude Code with the channel enabled:
> ```
> claude --channels plugin:remo-code@claude-plugins-official
> ```
> If the plugin isn't on the approved allowlist yet, use:
> ```
> claude --dangerously-load-development-channels plugin:remo-code@claude-plugins-official
> ```
